# ChanceToRain
The Chance of Rain App provides you a summary of today's weather and may suggest you whether to bring an umbrella or put on your sunscreen or not today.

## Functionalities:
* You can turn on you notifications for FB/Line Chatbots and mobile apps to:
  * Know whether you should bring your umbrella or put on sunscreen or not today.
  * Have an idea of what to wear today by:
    * knowing the temperature when you are traveling (temperature of 8am and 8pm);
    * knowing the highest temperature today.
  * Know whether you should put on your masks or not today by getting the PM2.5 index.
* In the Chance of Rain website, you will have a clear and simple view of today's weather.
